# project-client-dbaid

Using a starter pack from Naman Aulakh, located at https://github.com/NamanAulakh/react-native-expo-starter-kit.
This contains eslint, babel, redux and redux-thunk, expo (which will come in handy)
along with other libraries. This gives us a hello world to get started with react native
development.
