## Attribution

Using a starter pack from Naman Aulakh, located at https://github.com/NamanAulakh/react-native-expo-starter-kit.
This contains eslint, babel, redux and redux-thunk, expo (which will come in handy)
along with other libraries. This gives us a hello world to get started with react native
development.

## Deployment

Front-End Client
Our project is built on Expo, which allows for rapid deployment to devices. 
1. Download the Expo App on your mobile device.
2. Run `exp start` from the project directory to run the project.
3. Run `exp send -s <your-phone-number-or-email>` in your project directory in another terminal window to send the URL to your device.

=======
A starter kit to quickly start developing a react-native app which was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

For now, it includes following:
* `eslint`: to ensure error free code.
* `flow`: to understand most of your code, as it helps in easily traversing the code and understand relationships much better.
* `babel`: for es6.
* `redux`: to manage state of the app.
* `redux-thunk`: to help redux in handling api calls.
* `expo`: so that anyone can test the app on device.
* `react-navigation`: to implement navigation in the app.
* `lodash`: to help code in js.
* `husky`: to ensure that only error free code is pushed to git.
* `remote-redux-devtools`: to help visualize global redux store and actions.

Steps to run the project:
* `yarn install && npm run ios`  

If everything goes well, you should see this screen:
