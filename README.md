## Attribution

DBAid is an app designed to optimize the use of DBA at Dartmouth College. Users can post a listing for a certain amount of DBA that they are willing to donate at a specific dining hall. Other users can spawn a chat based on that listing and communicate about making the transaction.

## Architecture

Using a starter pack from Naman Aulakh, located at https://github.com/NamanAulakh/react-native-expo-starter-kit.
This contains eslint, babel, redux and redux-thunk, expo (which will come in handy)
along with other libraries. This gives us a hello world to get started with react native
development.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo into your local environment
2. Once cloned, `cd` into the directory and run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run `exp start` and connect to your personal phone!

## Deployment

Front-End Client
Our project is built on Expo, which allows for rapid deployment to devices.
1. Download the Expo App on your mobile device.
2. Run `exp start` from the project directory to run the project.
3. Run `exp send -s <your-phone-number-or-email>` in your project directory in another terminal window to send the URL to your device.

Alternatively, this app can be used on an iOS/Android simulator via Xcode.
1. If your computer does not have Xcode installed, download it and install from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/.
2. Run `exp start` from the project directory to run the project.
3. Run `exp ios` or `exp android` in your project directory in another terminal window to start up the simulator.
